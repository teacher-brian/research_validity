# Construction Validity

## Threats

1. Attention and contact

2. Single operations and narrow stimulus sampling

3. Experimenter Expectancy

4. Cues of the experimental situation  aka demand characteristics

# Statistical Conclusion Validity

## Threats

1. Low statistical power

2. Variability in Procedures

3. Subject Heterogeneity

4. Unreliability of measures

5. multiple comparison error rates


# Internal Validity

## Threats

1. History  --any unplanned event that happens in or out of the experiment during the course.  Fired from work, a student dies on UW campus in the middle of a year long experiment, impacted students are now different than students taking experiment before the death.

2.  maturation  Age, sophistication, 

3. Testing.  Taking a pretest may impact post test

4. Instrumentation Change in measurement instruments over time.  

5. Regression to the mean

6. Selection Biases  Systematic differences between groups based on selection or assignment

7. Attrition

8. Combination of selection and other threats.  If not using random assignment, you may get selection biases and related other biases like those above, like a history threat.

9. Diffusion or limitation of treatment.  An intervention given to one group is accidentally provided. Psychoanalyst in therapy also uses a little CBT.  

10. Special treatment or reactions of controls.  No treatment control group gets special tx such as more $, more monitoring, of well being or special privileges. 


# External Validity

## Threats

1. Sample characteristics  You can't generalize to groups that don't have these same traits

2. stimulus characteristics..things like settings.  A particular therapist, or other features of the experiment which may affect DV

3. contextual characteristics.  conditions in which the experiment is embedded.

    a. Reactivity of experimenal arrangement  --effect of fact that person knows she is being studied
    
    b. multple treatment interference  -- if subjects are exposed to more than one treatment, multiple treatment interference refers to drawing conlusions about a given tx in the context of other tx's
    
    c. No .... effects

4. Assessment characteristics

    a. reactiveity of assessment  extent to which people show change bec they know they've been assessed
    
    b. test sensitization does preteest change person amenability to tx?

    c. time measurement and tx effectgs
